lebatard-show-rss
================

Created after waiting long enough for ESPN Radio to get their act together with the Dan Lebatard Show with Stugotz podcast.

The official ESPN podcast feed does not conduce itself to easily to sorting as the publish date is the same for all the day's hours and the local hour podcast title is not like hours 1-3. This script will modify the publish dates for all the podcast entries so that they can easily be sorted by date.
